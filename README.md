Create a MySQL database by using 'Run SQL Script..' in MySQL Workbench to upload the BookStoreDB.sql schema file
For reference the ser_team2mysql.sql schema file should start with the following:

CREATE DATABASE BOOK_STORE_DB; USE BOOK_STORE_DB; CREATE TABLE USER ( UserID VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, Last_Name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, Middle_Name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, }

The script will populate the database with test/default values.

Tested with MySQL Community Version 8 but should be backwards compatible with previous versions.
